Restore schema
==============

.. note:: Currently, Scylla Manager supports only entire schema restoration, so ``--keyspace`` flag is not allowed.

.. note:: Because of small size of schema files, resuming schema restoration always starts from scratch.

In order to restore Scylla cluster schema use :ref:`sctool restore <sctool-restore>` with ``--restore-schema`` flag.

Prerequisites
=============

* Scylla Manager with CQL credentials to restore destination cluster.

* It is strongly advised to restore schema only into an empty cluster with no schema change history of the keyspace that is going to be restored.
   Otherwise, the restored schema might be overwritten by the already existing one and cause unexpected errors.

* All nodes in restore destination cluster should be in the ``UN`` state (See `nodetool status <https://docs.scylladb.com/stable/operating-scylla/nodetool-commands/status.html>`_ for details).

Follow-up action
================

After successful restore it is important to perform necessary follow-up action. In case of restoring schema,
you should make a `rolling restart <https://docs.scylladb.com/stable/operating-scylla/procedures/config-change/rolling-restart.html>`_ of an entire cluster.
Without the restart, the restored schema might not be visible, and querying it can return various errors.

It is recommended to drop all materialized views and secondary indexes that are part of the restored schema.
The next step, ``--restore-tables``, does not restore materialized views or secondary indexes.
It is the end user's responsibility to drop and recreate them after the tables have been successfully restored.

Process
=======

Because of being unable to alter schema tables ``tombstone_gc`` option, restore procedure "simulates ad-hoc repair"
by duplicating data from **each backed-up node into each node** in restore destination cluster.
Fortunately, the small size of schema files makes this overhead negligible.

    * Validate that all nodes are in the ``UN`` state
    * For each backup location:

      * Find all Scylla *nodes* with location access and use them for restoring schema from this location
      * List backup manifests for specified snapshot tag
    * For each manifest:

        * Filter relevant tables from the manifest
        * For each table:

          * For each *node* (in ``--parallel``):

            * Download all SSTables
    * For all nodes in restore destination cluster:

        * `nodetool refresh <https://docs.scylladb.com/stable/operating-scylla/nodetool-commands/refresh.html#nodetool-refresh>`_ on all downloaded schema tables (full parallel)
