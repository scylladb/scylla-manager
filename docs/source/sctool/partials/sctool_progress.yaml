usage: sctool progress --cluster <id|name> [--details] [--run UUID] [flags] <type>[/<id|name>]
options:
    - name: cluster
      shorthand: c
      usage: |
        The target cluster `name or ID` (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_CLUSTER).
    - name: details
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |

      default_value: "false"
      usage: help for progress
    - name: host
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |+
        A list of host `glob` patterns, e.g. '1.1.1.*,!1.2.*.4.'.
        The following syntax for glob patterns is supported:

        * '*' - matches any number of any characters including none
        * '?' - matches any single character
        * '[abc]' - matches one character given in the bracket
        * '[a-z]' - matches one character from the range given in the bracket

        Patterns are evaluated from left to right.
        If a pattern starts with '!' it unselects items that were selected by previous patterns i.e. 'a?,!aa' selects *ab* but not *aa*.

    - name: keyspace
      shorthand: K
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |+
        A list of `glob` patterns separated by a comma used to include or exclude tables.
        The patterns match keyspaces and tables, separate the keyspace name from the table name with a dot e.g. 'keyspace,!keyspace.table_prefix_*'.
        The following syntax for glob patterns is supported:

        * '*' - matches any number of any characters including none
        * '?' - matches any single character
        * '[abc]' - matches one character given in the bracket
        * '[a-z]' - matches one character from the range given in the bracket

        Patterns are evaluated from left to right.
        If a pattern starts with '!' it unselects items that were selected by previous patterns i.e. 'a?,!aa' selects *ab* but not *aa*.

      usage: |
        File `path` to HTTPS client certificate used to access the Scylla Manager server when client certificate validation is enabled (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_CERT_FILE).
    - name: api-key-file
      usage: |
        File `path` to HTTPS client key associated with --api-cert-file flag (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_KEY_FILE).
    - name: api-url
      default_value: http://127.0.0.1:5080/api/v1
      usage: |
        Base `URL` of Scylla Manager server (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_URL).
