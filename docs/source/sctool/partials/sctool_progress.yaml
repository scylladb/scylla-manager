  usage: |+
    A list of host `glob` patterns, e.g. '1.1.1.*,!1.2.*.4.'.
    The following syntax for glob patterns is supported:

    '*' - matches any number of any characters including none
    '?' - matches any single character
    '[abc]' - matches one character given in the bracket
    '[a-z]' - matches one character from the range given in the bracket

    Patterns are evaluated from left to right.
    If a pattern starts with '!' it unselects items that were selected by previous patterns i.e. 'a?,!aa' selects *ab* but not *aa*.

- name: keyspace
  shorthand: K
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |+
    A list of `glob` patterns separated by a comma used to include or exclude tables.
    The patterns match keyspaces and tables, separate the keyspace name from the table name with a dot e.g. 'keyspace,!keyspace.table_prefix_*'.
    The following syntax for glob patterns is supported:

    * '*' - matches any number of any characters including none
    * '?' - matches any single character
    * '[abc]' - matches one character given in the bracket
    * '[a-z]' - matches one character from the range given in the bracket
