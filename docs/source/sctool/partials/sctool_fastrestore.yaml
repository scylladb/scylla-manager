name: sctool fastrestore
synopsis: |
    Run an ad-hoc restore of tables to the cluster of the same topology as a backup.
description: "This command allows you to run ad-hoc restore of tables to the cluster of the same topology as a backup.\n**Note:** This command only restores the data within the tables. \nYou must first restore the schema of the database separately using the regular restore command with the `--restore-schema` flag.\n"
usage: sctool fastrestore --cluster <id|name> --location [<dc>:]<provider>:<bucket> --snapshot-tag <tag> [flags] --source-cluster-id <id> --nodes-mapping <filepath>
options:
    - name: allow-compaction
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Defines if auto compactions should be running on Scylla nodes during restore.
        Disabling auto compactions decreases restore time duration, but increases compaction workload after the restore is done.
    - name: batch-size
      default_value: "2"
      usage: |
        Number of SSTables per shard to process in one request by one node.
        Increasing the default batch size might significantly increase restore performance, as only one shard can work on restoring a single SSTable bundle.
        Set to 0 for best performance (batches will contain sstables of total size up to 5% of expected total node workload).
    - name: cluster
      shorthand: c
      usage: |
        The target cluster `name or ID` (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_CLUSTER).
    - name: cron
      usage: |
        Task schedule as a cron `expression`.
        It supports the extended syntax including @monthly, @weekly, @daily, @midnight, @hourly, @every X[h|m|s].
    - name: dry-run
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Validates and displays restore information without actually running the restore.
        This allows you to display what will happen should the restore run with the parameters you set.
    - name: enabled
      default_value: "true"
      usage: |
        Not enabled tasks are not executed and are hidden from the task list.
    - name: help
      shorthand: h
      default_value: "false"
      usage: help for fastrestore
    - name: interval
      shorthand: i
      usage: |
        --interval is deprecated, please use `--cron` instead


        Time after which a successfully completed task would be run again. The supported units are:

        * 'd' - days
        * 'h' - hours
        * 'm' - minutes
        * 's' - seconds
        * 'ms' - milliseconds

        The task run date is aligned with '--start date' value.
        For example, if you select '--interval 7d' task would run weekly at the '--start-date' time.
    - name: keyspace
      shorthand: K
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |+
        A list of `glob` patterns separated by a comma used to include or exclude tables.
        The patterns match keyspaces and tables, separate the keyspace name from the table name with a dot e.g. 'keyspace,!keyspace.table_prefix_*'.
        The following syntax for glob patterns is supported:

        * '*' - matches any number of any characters including none
        * '?' - matches any single character
        * '[abc]' - matches one character given in the bracket
        * '[a-z]' - matches one character from the range given in the bracket

        Patterns are evaluated from left to right.
        If a pattern starts with '!' it unselects items that were selected by previous patterns i.e. 'a?,!aa' selects *ab* but not *aa*.

    - name: label
      usage: |
        A comma-separated list of label modifications. Labels are represented as a key-value store.
        Character '=' has a special meaning and cannot be a part of label's key nor value.
        A single modification takes form of:
        * '<key>=<value>' - sets the label <key> to <value>
        * '<key>-'        - removes the label

        For example, '--label k1=v1,k2-' will set the label 'k1' to 'v1' and will also remove label 'k2'.
    - name: location
      shorthand: L
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |
        A list of backup locations separated by a comma, specifies places where restored backup is stored.

        The format is `[<dc>:]<provider>:<bucket>`.
        The `<dc>` parameter is optional. It allows you to specify the datacenter whose nodes will be used to restore the data
        from this location in a multi-dc setting, it must match Scylla nodes datacenter.
        By default, all live nodes are used to restore data from specified locations.

        Note that specifying datacenters closest to backup locations might reduce download time of restored data.
        The supported storage '<provider>'s are 'azure', 'gcs', 's3'.
        The `<bucket>` parameter is a bucket name, it must be an alphanumeric string and **may contain a dash and or a dot, but other characters are forbidden**.
    - name: name
      usage: |
        Task name that can be used instead of ID.
    - name: nodes-mapping
      usage: |
        Path to a file with source cluster and target cluster nodes mapping. Each line should contain node mapping in the following format <source_dc>:<source_rack>:<source_host_id>=<destination_dc>:<destination_rack>:<destination_host_id>
    - name: num-retries
      shorthand: r
      default_value: "3"
      usage: |
        Number of times a task reruns following a failure.
    - name: parallel
      default_value: "0"
      usage: |
        The maximum number of Scylla restore jobs that can be run at the same time (on different SSTables).
        Each node can take part in at most one restore at any given moment.
    - name: rate-limit
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |
        Limits the download rate (as expressed in  megabytes (MiB) per second) at which sstables can be downloaded from backup location to Scylla nodes.
        You can set limits for more than one DC using a comma-separated list expressed in the format `[<dc>:]<limit>`.
        The <dc>: part is optional and is only needed when different datacenters require different download limits.
        Set to 0 for no limit (default 0).
    - name: retry-wait
      default_value: 10m
      usage: |
        Initial exponential backoff `duration` X[h|m|s].
        With --retry-wait 10m task will wait 10 minutes, 20 minutes and 40 minutes after first, second and third consecutire failure.
    - name: show-tables
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Prints table names together with keyspace, used in combination with --dry-run.
    - name: snapshot-tag
      shorthand: T
      usage: |
        Scylla Manager snapshot tag identifying restored backup.
        Snapshot tags can be obtained from backup listing ('./sctool backup list' command - e.g. sm_20060102150405UTC).
    - name: source-cluster-id
      usage: |
        Cluster id of the backup cluster.
    - name: start-date
      shorthand: s
      usage: |
        The date can be expressed relatively to now or as a RFC3339 formatted string.
        To run the task in 2 hours use 'now+2h'. The supported units are:

        * 'd' - days
        * 'h' - hours
        * 'm' - minutes
        * 's' - seconds
        * 'ms' - milliseconds

        If you want the task to start at a specified date use RFC3339 formatted string i.e. '2018-01-02T15:04:05-07:00'.
        If you want the repair to start immediately, use the value 'now' or skip this flag.
    - name: timezone
      default_value: UTC
      usage: |
        Timezone of --cron and --window flag values.
        The default value is taken from this system, namely 'TZ' envvar or '/etc/localtime' file.
    - name: transfers
      default_value: "0"
      usage: |
        Sets the amount of file transfers to run in parallel when downloading files from backup location to Scylla node.
        Set to 0 for the fastest download (results in setting transfers to 2*node_shard_count).
        Set to -1 for using the transfers value defined in node's 'scylla-manager-agent.yaml' config file.
    - name: unpin-agent-cpu
      default_value: "false"
      usage: "Defines if ScyllaDB Manager Agent should be unpinned from CPUs during restore.\nThis might significantly improve download speed at the cost of decreasing streaming speed. \n"
    - name: window
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |
        A comma-separated list of time markers in a form `[WEEKDAY-]HH:MM`.
        WEEKDAY can be written as the whole word or only using the first 3 characters, HH:MM is an hour from 00:00 to 23:59.

        * 'MON-00:00,FRI-15:00' - can be executed from Monday to Friday 3PM
        * '23:00,06:00' - can be executed every night from 11PM to 6AM
