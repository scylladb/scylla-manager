name: sctool repair control
synopsis: Change parameters while a repair is running
description: |
  This command allows you to change repair parameters while a repair is running.
usage: sctool repair control --cluster <id|name> [flags]
options:
- name: cluster
  shorthand: c
  usage: |
    The target cluster `name or ID` (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_CLUSTER).
- name: help
  shorthand: h
  default_value: "false"
  usage: help for control
- name: intensity
  default_value: "1"
  usage: |
    How many token ranges per shard to repair in a single Scylla node at the same time.
    It can be a decimal between (0,1), in that case it specifies percent of shards that can be repaired in parallel on a repair master node.
    Zero (0) is a special value, the number of token ranges is adjusted to the maximum supported by node (see max_repair_ranges_in_parallel in Scylla logs).
    Changing the intensity impacts repair granularity if you need to resume it, the higher the value the more work on resume.
- name: parallel
  default_value: "0"
  usage: |
    The maximum number of Scylla repair jobs that can run at the same time (on different token ranges and replicas).
    Each node can take part in at most one repair at any given moment.
    By default the maximum possible parallelism is used.
    The effective parallelism depends on a keyspace replication factor (RF) and the number of nodes.
    The formula to calculate is is as follows: number of nodes / RF, ex. for 6 node cluster with RF=3 the maximum parallelism is 2.
inherited_options:
- name: api-cert-file
  usage: |
    File `path` to HTTPS client certificate used to access the Scylla Manager server when client certificate validation is enabled (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_CERT_FILE).
- name: api-key-file
  usage: |
    File `path` to HTTPS client key associated with --api-cert-file flag (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_KEY_FILE).
- name: api-url
  default_value: http://127.0.0.1:5080/api/v1
  usage: |
    Base `URL` of Scylla Manager server (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_URL).
    If running sctool on the same machine as server, it's generated based on '/etc/scylla-manager/scylla-manager.yaml' file.
