name: sctool backup list
synopsis: List backups
description: |
    This command allow you to list backups from given locations. The command works per cluster and all the locations listed with the `--location` flag must be accessible from the cluster specified with the `--cluster` flag.
    This cluster serves as the coordinator for all these checks. If the Scylla Manager Agent's of given cluster is not able to reach the location, the command will fail.
usage: sctool backup list --cluster <id|name> [flags]
options:
    - name: all-clusters
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Shows backups for all clusters. Useful for listing clusters that are no longer available locally but are backed up in the past to remote location.
    - name: cluster
      shorthand: c
      usage: |
        The target cluster `name or ID` (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_CLUSTER).
    - name: help
      shorthand: h
      default_value: "false"
      usage: help for list
    - name: keyspace
      shorthand: K
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |+
        A list of `glob` patterns separated by a comma used to include or exclude tables.
        The patterns match keyspaces and tables, separate the keyspace name from the table name with a dot e.g. 'keyspace,!keyspace.table_prefix_*'.
        The following syntax for glob patterns is supported:

        * '*' - matches any number of any characters including none
        * '?' - matches any single character
        * '[abc]' - matches one character given in the bracket
        * '[a-z]' - matches one character from the range given in the bracket

        Patterns are evaluated from left to right.
        If a pattern starts with '!' it unselects items that were selected by previous patterns i.e. 'a?,!aa' selects *ab* but not *aa*.

    - name: location
      shorthand: L
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |
        A list of backup locations separated by a comma, specifies where to place the backup, the format is `[<dc>:]<provider>:<bucket>`.
        The '<dc>' parameter is optional it allows to specify location for a datacenter in a multi-dc setting, it must match Scylla nodes datacenter.
        The supported storage '<provider>'s are 'azure', 'gcs', 's3'.
        The 'name' parameter is a bucket name, it must be an alphanumeric string and **may contain a dash and or a dot, but other characters are forbidden**.
    - name: max-date
      usage: |
        Specifies maximal snapshot `date` expressed in RFC3339 form or 'now[+duration]', ex. 'now+3d2h10m'.
        Valid units are:

        * 'd' - days
        * 'h' - hours
        * 'm' - minutes
        * 's' - seconds
        * 'now' - happens immediately
    - name: min-date
      usage: |
        Specifies minimal snapshot `date` expressed in RFC3339 form or 'now[+duration]', ex. 'now+3d2h10m'.
        Valid units are:

        * 'd' - days
        * 'h' - hours
        * 'm' - minutes
        * 's' - seconds
        * 'now' - happens immediately
    - name: show-tables
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Prints table names together with keyspace.
inherited_options:
    - name: api-cert-file
      usage: |
        File `path` to HTTPS client certificate used to access the Scylla Manager server when client certificate validation is enabled (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_CERT_FILE).
    - name: api-key-file
      usage: |
        File `path` to HTTPS client key associated with --api-cert-file flag (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_KEY_FILE).
    - name: api-url
      default_value: http://127.0.0.1:5080/api/v1
      usage: |
        Base `URL` of Scylla Manager server (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_URL).
        If running sctool on the same machine as server, it's generated based on '/etc/scylla-manager/scylla-manager.yaml' file.
