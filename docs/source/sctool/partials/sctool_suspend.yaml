name: sctool suspend
synopsis: Stop execution of all tasks
description: |
    This command stops execution of **all** tasks that are running on a cluster.
    The tasks can be resumed using the resume command.

    When the suspend command is executed:

    * The running tasks are stopped
    * The scheduled tasks are canceled
    * Starting a task manually fails

    The health check tasks are an exception and they run even after suspend.
usage: sctool suspend --cluster <id|name> [--duration] [--on-resume-start-tasks] [flags]
options:
    - name: cluster
      shorthand: c
      usage: |
        The target cluster `name or ID` (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_CLUSTER).
    - name: cron
      usage: |
        Task schedule as a cron `expression`.
        It supports the extended syntax including @monthly, @weekly, @daily, @midnight, @hourly, @every X[h|m|s].
    - name: duration
      usage: Automatically resume after the given `duration` X[h|m|s].
    - name: enabled
      default_value: "true"
      usage: |
        Not enabled tasks are not executed and are hidden from the task list.
    - name: help
      shorthand: h
      default_value: "false"
      usage: help for suspend
    - name: interval
      shorthand: i
      usage: |
        --interval is deprecated, please use `--cron` instead


        Time after which a successfully completed task would be run again. The supported units are:

        * 'd' - days
        * 'h' - hours
        * 'm' - minutes
        * 's' - seconds
        * 'ms' - milliseconds

        The task run date is aligned with '--start date' value.
        For example, if you select '--interval 7d' task would run weekly at the '--start-date' time.
    - name: label
      usage: |
        A comma-separated list of label modifications. Labels are represented as a key-value store.
        Character '=' has a special meaning and cannot be a part of label's key nor value.
        A single modification takes form of:
        * '<key>=<value>' - sets the label <key> to <value>
        * '<key>-'        - removes the label

        For example, '--label k1=v1,k2-' will set the label 'k1' to 'v1' and will also remove label 'k2'.
    - name: name
      usage: |
        Task name that can be used instead of ID.
    - name: num-retries
      shorthand: r
      default_value: "3"
      usage: |
        Number of times a task reruns following a failure.
    - name: on-resume-start-tasks
      default_value: "false"
      usage: On resume start tasks that were stopped by the suspend.
    - name: retry-wait
      default_value: 10m
      usage: |
        Initial exponential backoff `duration` X[h|m|s].
        With --retry-wait 10m task will wait 10 minutes, 20 minutes and 40 minutes after first, second and third consecutire failure.
    - name: start-date
      shorthand: s
      usage: |
        The date can be expressed relatively to now or as a RFC3339 formatted string.
        To run the task in 2 hours use 'now+2h'. The supported units are:

        * 'd' - days
        * 'h' - hours
        * 'm' - minutes
        * 's' - seconds
        * 'ms' - milliseconds

        If you want the task to start at a specified date use RFC3339 formatted string i.e. '2018-01-02T15:04:05-07:00'.
        If you want the repair to start immediately, use the value 'now' or skip this flag.
    - name: timezone
      default_value: UTC
      usage: |
        Timezone of --cron and --window flag values.
        The default value is taken from this system, namely 'TZ' envvar or '/etc/localtime' file.
    - name: window
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |
        A comma-separated list of time markers in a form `[WEEKDAY-]HH:MM`.
        WEEKDAY can be written as the whole word or only using the first 3 characters, HH:MM is an hour from 00:00 to 23:59.

        * 'MON-00:00,FRI-15:00' - can be executed from Monday to Friday 3PM
        * '23:00,06:00' - can be executed every night from 11PM to 6AM
        * '23:00,06:00,SAT-00:00,SUN-23:59' - can be executed every night from 11PM to 6AM and all day during the weekend
