name: sctool backup update
synopsis: Modify properties of the existing backup task
description: |
    This command allows you to modify properties of an already existing backup task.
    If there is one backup task the 'backup/<id|name>' argument is not needed.
usage: sctool backup update --cluster <id|name> [flags] [backup/<id|name>]
options:
    - name: cluster
      shorthand: c
      usage: |
        The target cluster `name or ID` (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_CLUSTER).
    - name: cron
      usage: |
        Task schedule as a cron `expression`.
        It supports the extended syntax including @monthly, @weekly, @daily, @midnight, @hourly, @every X[h|m|s].
    - name: dc
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |+
        A list of datacenter `glob` patterns separated by a comma, e.g. 'dc1,!otherdc*' used to specify the datacenters to include or exclude.
        The following syntax for glob patterns is supported:

        * '*' - matches any number of any characters including none
        * '?' - matches any single character
        * '[abc]' - matches one character given in the bracket
        * '[a-z]' - matches one character from the range given in the bracket

        Patterns are evaluated from left to right.
        If a pattern starts with '!' it unselects items that were selected by previous patterns i.e. 'a?,!aa' selects *ab* but not *aa*.

    - name: dry-run
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Validates and prints backup information without actually scheduling a backup.
    - name: enabled
      default_value: "true"
      usage: |
        Not enabled tasks are not executed and are hidden from the task list.
    - name: help
      shorthand: h
      default_value: "false"
      usage: help for update
    - name: interval
      shorthand: i
      usage: |
        --interval is deprecated, please use `--cron` instead


        Time after which a successfully completed task would be run again. The supported units are:

        * 'd' - days
        * 'h' - hours
        * 'm' - minutes
        * 's' - seconds
        * 'ms' - milliseconds

        The task run date is aligned with '--start date' value.
        For example, if you select '--interval 7d' task would run weekly at the '--start-date' time.
    - name: keyspace
      shorthand: K
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |+
        A list of `glob` patterns separated by a comma used to include or exclude tables.
        The patterns match keyspaces and tables, separate the keyspace name from the table name with a dot e.g. 'keyspace,!keyspace.table_prefix_*'.
        The following syntax for glob patterns is supported:

        * '*' - matches any number of any characters including none
        * '?' - matches any single character
        * '[abc]' - matches one character given in the bracket
        * '[a-z]' - matches one character from the range given in the bracket

        Patterns are evaluated from left to right.
        If a pattern starts with '!' it unselects items that were selected by previous patterns i.e. 'a?,!aa' selects *ab* but not *aa*.

    - name: label
      usage: |
        A comma-separated list of label modifications. Labels are represented as a key-value store.
        Character '=' has a special meaning and cannot be a part of label's key nor value.
        A single modification takes form of:
        * '<key>=<value>' - sets the label <key> to <value>
        * '<key>-'        - removes the label

        For example, '--label k1=v1,k2-' will set the label 'k1' to 'v1' and will also remove label 'k2'.
    - name: location
      shorthand: L
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |
        A list of backup locations separated by a comma, specifies where to place the backup, the format is `[<dc>:]<provider>:<bucket>`.
        The '<dc>' parameter is optional it allows to specify location for a datacenter in a multi-dc setting, it must match Scylla nodes datacenter.
        The supported storage '<provider>'s are 'azure', 'gcs', 's3'.
        The 'bucket' parameter is a bucket name, it must be an alphanumeric string and **may contain a dash and or a dot, but other characters are forbidden**.
    - name: name
      usage: |
        Task name that can be used instead of ID.
    - name: num-retries
      shorthand: r
      default_value: "3"
      usage: |
        Number of times a task reruns following a failure.
    - name: purge-only
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Run the backup cleanup only.
    - name: rate-limit
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |
        Limits the upload rate (as expressed in  megabytes (MiB) per second) at which snapshotfiles can be uploaded from a Scylla node to its backup destination.
        You can set limits for more than one DC using a comma-separated list expressed in the format `[<dc>:]<limit>`.
        The <dc>: part is optional and is only needed when different datacenters require different upload limits.
        Set to 0 for no limit (default 100).
    - name: retention
      default_value: "7"
      usage: |
        The `number of backups` to store, once this number is reached, the next backup which comes in from this destination will initiate a purge of the oldest backup.
        Can be used simultaneously with '--retention-days' flag.
    - name: retention-days
      default_value: "0"
      usage: |
        The `number of days` for which backup is stored, the next backup will initiate a purge of all expired backups.
        Can be used simultaneously with '--retention' flag.
    - name: retry-wait
      default_value: 10m
      usage: |
        Initial exponential backoff `duration` X[h|m|s].
        With --retry-wait 10m task will wait 10 minutes, 20 minutes and 40 minutes after first, second and third consecutire failure.
    - name: show-tables
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Prints table names together with keyspace, used in combination with --dry-run.
    - name: snapshot-parallel
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |
        A comma-separated list of snapshot parallelism limits in the format `[<dc>:]<limit>`.
        The 'dc' part is optional and allows for specifying different limits in selected datacenters.
        If the 'dc' part is not set, the limit is global and the runs are parallel in 'n' nodes.
        If for example, you were to set 'dc1:2,5', then 'dc1' would have two parallel nodes and there would be five parallel nodes in the other DCs.
    - name: start-date
      shorthand: s
      usage: |
        The date can be expressed relatively to now or as a RFC3339 formatted string.
        To run the task in 2 hours use 'now+2h'. The supported units are:

        * 'd' - days
        * 'h' - hours
        * 'm' - minutes
        * 's' - seconds
        * 'ms' - milliseconds

        If you want the task to start at a specified date use RFC3339 formatted string i.e. '2018-01-02T15:04:05-07:00'.
        If you want the repair to start immediately, use the value 'now' or skip this flag.
    - name: timezone
      default_value: UTC
      usage: |
        Timezone of --cron and --window flag values.
        The default value is taken from this system, namely 'TZ' envvar or '/etc/localtime' file.
    - name: upload-parallel
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |
        A comma-separated list of upload parallelism limits in the format `[<dc>:]<limit>`.
        The 'dc' part is optional and allows for specifying different limits in selected datacenters.
        If the 'dc' part is not set, the limit is global (e.g. 'dc1:2,5') the runs are parallel in 'n' nodes.
        If for example, you were to set 'dc1:2,5', then 'dc1' would have two parallel nodes and there would be five parallel nodes in the other DCs.
    - name: window
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |
        A comma-separated list of time markers in a form `[WEEKDAY-]HH:MM`.
        WEEKDAY can be written as the whole word or only using the first 3 characters, HH:MM is an hour from 00:00 to 23:59.
