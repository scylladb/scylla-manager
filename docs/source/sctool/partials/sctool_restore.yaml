name: sctool restore
synopsis: Schedule a restore of schema or tables (ad-hoc or scheduled)
description: |
  This command allows you to schedule or run ad-hoc cluster restore.
  Restore is always one of two types: restore schema ('--restore-schema' flag) or restore tables' contents ('--restore-tables' flag).
  In both cases, for the restore effects to be visible, you need to perform
  a specific follow-up action described by selected type.
usage: sctool restore --cluster <id|name> --location [<dc>:]<provider>:<bucket> --snapshot-tag <tag> [flags]
options:
- name: batch-size
  default_value: "2"
  usage: |
    Number of SSTables per shard to process in one request by one node.
    Increasing batch size increases job granularity.
- name: cluster
  shorthand: c
  usage: |
    The target cluster `name or ID` (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_CLUSTER).
- name: cron
  usage: |
    Task schedule as a cron `expression`.
    It supports the extended syntax including @monthly, @weekly, @daily, @midnight, @hourly, @every X[h|m|s].
- name: dry-run
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Validates and displays restore information without actually scheduling the restore.
    This allows you to display what will happen should the restore run with the parameters you set.
- name: enabled
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    Not enabled tasks are not executed and are hidden from the task list.
- name: help
  shorthand: h
  default_value: "false"
  usage: help for restore
- name: interval
  shorthand: i
  usage: |
    --interval is deprecated, please use `--cron` instead
    
    
    Time after which a successfully completed task would be run again. The supported units are:

    * 'd' - days
    * 'h' - hours
    * 'm' - minutes
    * 's' - seconds
    * 'ms' - milliseconds

    The task run date is aligned with '--start date' value.
    For example, if you select '--interval 7d' task would run weekly at the '--start-date' time.
- name: keyspace
  shorthand: K
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |+
    A list of `glob` patterns separated by a comma used to include or exclude tables.
    The patterns match keyspaces and tables, separate the keyspace name from the table name with a dot e.g. 'keyspace,!keyspace.table_prefix_*'.
    The following syntax for glob patterns is supported:

    * '*' - matches any number of any characters including none
    * '?' - matches any single character
    * '[abc]' - matches one character given in the bracket
    * '[a-z]' - matches one character from the range given in the bracket

    Patterns are evaluated from left to right.
    If a pattern starts with '!' it unselects items that were selected by previous patterns i.e. 'a?,!aa' selects *ab* but not *aa*.

- name: location
  shorthand: L
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    A list of backup locations separated by a comma, specifies places where restored backup is stored.
    
    The format is `[<dc>:]<provider>:<bucket>`.
    The `<dc>` parameter is optional. It allows you to specify the datacenter whose nodes will be used to restore the data
    from this location in a multi-dc setting, it must match Scylla nodes datacenter.
    By default, all live nodes are used to restore data from specified locations.
        
    Note that specifying datacenters closest to backup locations might reduce download time of restored data.
    The supported storage '<provider>'s are 'azure', 'gcs', 's3'.
    The `<bucket>` parameter is a bucket name, it must be an alphanumeric string and **may contain a dash and or a dot, but other characters are forbidden**.
- name: name
  usage: |
    Task name that can be used insead of ID.
- name: num-retries
  shorthand: r
  default_value: "3"
  usage: |
    Number of times a task reruns following a failure.
- name: parallel
  default_value: "1"
  usage: |
    The maximum number of Scylla restore jobs that can be run at the same time (on different SSTables).
    Each node can take part in at most one restore at any given moment.
- name: restore-schema
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Specifies restore type (alternative to '--restore-tables' flag).
    Restore will recreate schema by targeting 'system_schema.*' tables only ('--keyspace' flag mustn't be set).
    It requires that restored keyspaces aren't present in the cluster.
    For the schema to be visible, restart of the entire cluster is required after completion.
    See `ScyllaDB cluster restart <https://docs.scylladb.com/stable/operating-scylla/procedures/config-change/rolling-restart.html>`_ for details.
- name: restore-tables
  default_value: "false"
  usage: "Specifies restore type (alternative to '--restore-schema' flag).\nRestore will recreate contents of tables specified by '--keyspace' flag.\nIt requires that correct schema of restored tables is already present in the cluster (schema can be restored using '--restore-schema' flag).\nMoreover, in order to prevent situation in which current tables' contents overlaps restored data,\ntables should be truncated before initializing restore. \nFor the table contents to be visible, repair of the entire cluster is required after completion.\nSee ref:`sctool restore <sctool-restore>` for details.\n"
- name: retry-wait
  default_value: 10m
  usage: |
    Initial exponential backoff `duration` X[h|m|s].
    With --retry-wait 10m task will wait 10 minutes, 20 minutes and 40 minutes after first, second and third consecutire failure.
- name: show-tables
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Prints table names together with keyspace, used in combination with --dry-run.
- name: snapshot-tag
  shorthand: T
  usage: |
    Scylla Manager snapshot tag identifying restored backup.
    Snapshot tags can be obtained from backup listing ('./sctool backup list' command - e.g. sm_20060102150405UTC).
- name: start-date
  shorthand: s
  usage: |
    --start-date is deprecated, please use `--cron` instead
    
    The date can be expressed relatively to now or as a RFC3339 formatted string.
    To run the task in 2 hours use 'now+2h'. The supported units are:

    * 'd' - days
    * 'h' - hours
    * 'm' - minutes
    * 's' - seconds
    * 'ms' - milliseconds

    If you want the task to start at a specified date use RFC3339 formatted string i.e. '2018-01-02T15:04:05-07:00'.
    If you want the repair to start immediately, use the value 'now' or skip this flag.
- name: timezone
  default_value: UTC
  usage: |
    Timezone of --cron and --window flag values.
    The default value is taken from this system, namely 'TZ' envvar or '/etc/localtime' file.
- name: window
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    A comma-separated list of time markers in a form `[WEEKDAY-]HH:MM`.
    WEEKDAY can be written as the whole word or only using the first 3 characters, HH:MM is an hour from 00:00 to 23:59.

    'MON-00:00,FRI-15:00' - can be executed from Monday to Friday 3PM
    '23:00,06:00' - can be executed every night from 11PM to 6AM
    '23:00,06:00,SAT-00:00,SUN-23:59' - can be executed every night from 11PM to 6AM and all day during the weekend
inherited_options:
