name: sctool cluster update
synopsis: Modify a cluster
description: |
    This command modifies managed cluster parameters
usage: sctool cluster update --cluster <id|name> [flags]
options:
    - name: auth-token
      usage: |
        The authentication `token` you identified in '/etc/scylla-manager-agent/scylla-manager-agent.yaml'.
    - name: cluster
      shorthand: c
      usage: |
        The target cluster `name or ID` (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_CLUSTER).
    - name: delete-cql-credentials
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Deletes CQL username and password, added with --username and --password.
    - name: delete-ssl-user-cert
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Deletes SSL user certificate, added with --ssl-user-cert-file flag.
    - name: force-non-ssl-session-port
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Forces Scylla Manager to always use the non-SSL port for TLS-enabled cluster CQL sessions.
    - name: force-tls-disabled
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Forces Scylla Manager to always disable TLS for the cluster's CQL session, even if TLS is enabled in scylla.yaml.
    - name: help
      shorthand: h
      default_value: "false"
      usage: help for update
    - name: host
      usage: |
        Hostname or `IP` of the node that will be used to discover other nodes belonging to the cluster.
        Note that this will be persisted and used every time Scylla Manager starts.
        You can use either an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
    - name: label
      usage: |
        A comma-separated list of label modifications. Labels are represented as a key-value store.
        Character '=' has a special meaning and cannot be a part of label's key nor value.
        A single modification takes form of:
        * '<key>=<value>' - sets the label <key> to <value>
        * '<key>-'        - removes the label

        For example, '--label k1=v1,k2-' will set the label 'k1' to 'v1' and will also remove label 'k2'.
    - name: name
      shorthand: "n"
      usage: |
        When a cluster is added, it is assigned a unique identifier.
        Use this parameter to identify the cluster by an alias name which is more meaningful.
        This `alias` name can be used with all commands that accept --cluster parameter.
    - name: password
      shorthand: p
      usage: |
        CQL `password` associated with username.
    - name: port
      default_value: "10001"
      usage: |
        Alternate Scylla Manager agent `port`.
    - name: ssl-user-cert-file
      usage: |
        File `path` to client certificate when Scylla uses client/server encryption (require_client_auth enabled).
    - name: ssl-user-key-file
      usage: |
        File `path` to key associated with --ssl-user-cert-file flag.
    - name: username
      shorthand: u
      usage: |
        CQL `username`, for security reasons this user should NOT have access to your data.
        If you specify the CQL username and password, the CQL health check you see in status command would try to login and execute a query against system keyspace.
        Otherwise CQL health check is based on sending CQL OPTIONS frame and does not start a CQL session.
inherited_options:
    - name: api-cert-file
      usage: |
        File `path` to HTTPS client certificate used to access the Scylla Manager server when client certificate validation is enabled (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_CERT_FILE).
    - name: api-key-file
      usage: |
        File `path` to HTTPS client key associated with --api-cert-file flag (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_KEY_FILE).
    - name: api-url
      default_value: http://127.0.0.1:5080/api/v1
      usage: |
        Base `URL` of Scylla Manager server (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_URL).
        If running sctool on the same machine as server, it's generated based on '/etc/scylla-manager/scylla-manager.yaml' file.
example: |
    In this example, the cluster named ``cluster`` has been renamed to ``prod-cluster``.

    sctool cluster update -c cluster --name prod-cluster
