name: sctool cluster update
synopsis: Modify a cluster
description: |
  This command modifies managed cluster parameters
usage: sctool cluster update --cluster <id|name> [flags]
options:
- name: auth-token
  usage: |
    The authentication `token` you identified in '/etc/scylla-manager-agent/scylla-manager-agent.yaml'.
- name: cluster
  shorthand: c
  usage: |
    The target cluster `name or ID` (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_CLUSTER).
- name: delete-cql-credentials
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Deletes CQL username and password, added with --username and --password.
- name: delete-ssl-user-cert
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Deletes SSL user certificate, added with --ssl-user-cert-file flag.
- name: help
  shorthand: h
  default_value: "false"
  usage: help for update
- name: host
  usage: |
    Hostname or `IP` of the node that will be used to discover other nodes belonging to the cluster.
    Note that this will be persisted and used every time Scylla Manager starts.
    You can use either an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
- name: name
  shorthand: "n"
  usage: |
    When a cluster is added, it is assigned a unique identifier.
    Use this parameter to identify the cluster by an alias name which is more meaningful.
    This `alias` name can be used with all commands that accept --cluster parameter.
- name: password
  shorthand: p
  usage: |
    CQL `password` associated with username.
- name: port
  default_value: "10001"
  usage: |
    Alternate Scylla Manager agent `port`.
- name: ssl-user-cert-file
  usage: |
    File `path` to client certificate when Scylla uses client/server encryption (require_client_auth enabled).
- name: ssl-user-key-file
  usage: |
    File `path` to key associated with --ssl-user-cert-file flag.
- name: username
  shorthand: u
  usage: |
    CQL `username`, for security reasons this user should NOT have access to your data.
    If you specify the CQL username and password, the CQL health check you see in status command would try to login and execute a query against system keyspace.
    Otherwise CQL health check is based on sending CQL OPTIONS frame and does not start a CQL session.
inherited_options:
- name: api-cert-file
  usage: |
    File `path` to HTTPS client certificate used to access the Scylla Manager server when client certificate validation is enabled (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_CERT_FILE).
- name: api-key-file
  usage: |
    File `path` to HTTPS client key associated with --api-cert-file flag (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_KEY_FILE).
- name: api-url
  default_value: http://127.0.0.1:5080/api/v1
  usage: |
    Base `URL` of Scylla Manager server (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_URL).
    If running sctool on the same machine as server, it's generated based on '/etc/scylla-manager/scylla-manager.yaml' file.
example: |
  In this example, the cluster named 'cluster' has been renamed to 'prod-cluster'.

  sctool cluster update -c cluster --name prod-cluster
