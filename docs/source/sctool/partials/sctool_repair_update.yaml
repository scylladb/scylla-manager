name: sctool repair update
synopsis: Modify properties of the existing repair task
description: |
    This command allows you to modify parameters of an already existing repair task.
    If there is one repair task the 'repair/task-id' argument is not needed.
    Note that modified parameters apply only to the future task runs and not to the already running task.
    For modifying already running repair task on the fly see 'sctool repair control' command.
usage: sctool repair update --cluster <id|name> [flags] [<repair/task-id>]
options:
    - name: cluster
      shorthand: c
      usage: |
        The target cluster `name or ID` (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_CLUSTER).
    - name: cron
      usage: |
        Task schedule as a cron `expression`.
        It supports the extended syntax including @monthly, @weekly, @daily, @midnight, @hourly, @every X[h|m|s].
    - name: dc
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |+
        A list of datacenter `glob` patterns separated by a comma, e.g. 'dc1,!otherdc*' used to specify the datacenters to include or exclude.
        The following syntax for glob patterns is supported:

        * '*' - matches any number of any characters including none
        * '?' - matches any single character
        * '[abc]' - matches one character given in the bracket
        * '[a-z]' - matches one character from the range given in the bracket

        Patterns are evaluated from left to right.
        If a pattern starts with '!' it unselects items that were selected by previous patterns i.e. 'a?,!aa' selects *ab* but not *aa*.

    - name: dry-run
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Validates and displays repair information without actually scheduling the repair.
        This allows you to display what will happen should the repair run with the parameters you set.
    - name: enabled
      default_value: "true"
      usage: |
        Not enabled tasks are not executed and are hidden from the task list.
    - name: fail-fast
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Stops the task run on the first error.
    - name: help
      shorthand: h
      default_value: "false"
      usage: help for update
    - name: host
      usage: |
        Address of a node to repair, you can use either an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
        Specifying the host flag limits repair to token ranges replicated by a given node.
        It can be used in conjunction with --dc flag, in such a case the node must belong to the specified datacenters.
    - name: ignore-down-hosts
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Do not repair nodes that are down i.e. in status DN.
    - name: intensity
      default_value: "1"
      usage: |
        How many token ranges to repair in a single Scylla node at the same time.
        Zero (0) is a special value, the number of token ranges is adjusted to the maximum supported (see repair docs for more information).
        Changing the intensity impacts repair granularity if you need to resume it, the higher the value the more work on resume.
        If you set intensity to a value greater than the maximum supported by the node, intensity will be capped at that maximum.
        See effectively used intensity value in the display of 'sctool progress repair' command.
    - name: interval
      shorthand: i
      usage: |
        --interval is deprecated, please use `--cron` instead


        Time after which a successfully completed task would be run again. The supported units are:

        * 'd' - days
        * 'h' - hours
        * 'm' - minutes
        * 's' - seconds
        * 'ms' - milliseconds

        The task run date is aligned with '--start date' value.
        For example, if you select '--interval 7d' task would run weekly at the '--start-date' time.
    - name: keyspace
      shorthand: K
      default_value: '[*,!system_traces]'
      usage: |+
        A list of `glob` patterns separated by a comma used to include or exclude tables.
        The patterns match keyspaces and tables, separate the keyspace name from the table name with a dot e.g. 'keyspace,!keyspace.table_prefix_*'.
        The following syntax for glob patterns is supported:

        * '*' - matches any number of any characters including none
        * '?' - matches any single character
        * '[abc]' - matches one character given in the bracket
        * '[a-z]' - matches one character from the range given in the bracket

        Patterns are evaluated from left to right.
        If a pattern starts with '!' it unselects items that were selected by previous patterns i.e. 'a?,!aa' selects *ab* but not *aa*.

    - name: label
      usage: |
        A comma-separated list of label modifications. Labels are represented as a key-value store.
        Character '=' has a special meaning and cannot be a part of label's key nor value.
        A single modification takes form of:
        * '<key>=<value>' - sets the label <key> to <value>
        * '<key>-'        - removes the label

        For example, '--label k1=v1,k2-' will set the label 'k1' to 'v1' and will also remove label 'k2'.
    - name: name
      usage: |
        Task name that can be used instead of ID.
    - name: num-retries
      shorthand: r
      default_value: "3"
      usage: |
        Number of times a task reruns following a failure.
    - name: parallel
      default_value: "0"
      usage: |
        The maximum number of Scylla repair jobs that can run at the same time (on different token ranges and replicas).
        Each node can take part in at most one repair at any given moment. By default the maximum possible parallelism is used.
        The maximal effective parallelism depends on keyspace replication strategy and cluster topology (see repair docs for more information).
        If you set parallel to a value greater than the maximum supported by the node, parallel will be capped at that maximum.
        See effectively used parallel value in the display of 'sctool progress repair' command.
    - name: retry-wait
      default_value: 10m
      usage: |
        Initial exponential backoff `duration` X[h|m|s].
        With --retry-wait 10m task will wait 10 minutes, 20 minutes and 40 minutes after first, second and third consecutire failure.
    - name: show-tables
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Prints table names together with keyspace, used in combination with --dry-run.
    - name: small-table-threshold
      default_value: 1G
      usage: |
        Enables small table optimization for tables of size lower than given threshold, supported units [B, M, G, T].
    - name: start-date
      shorthand: s
      usage: |
        The date can be expressed relatively to now or as a RFC3339 formatted string.
        To run the task in 2 hours use 'now+2h'. The supported units are:

        * 'd' - days
        * 'h' - hours
        * 'm' - minutes
        * 's' - seconds
        * 'ms' - milliseconds

        If you want the task to start at a specified date use RFC3339 formatted string i.e. '2018-01-02T15:04:05-07:00'.
        If you want the repair to start immediately, use the value 'now' or skip this flag.
    - name: timezone
      default_value: UTC
      usage: |
        Timezone of --cron and --window flag values.
        The default value is taken from this system, namely 'TZ' envvar or '/etc/localtime' file.
    - name: window
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |
        A comma-separated list of time markers in a form `[WEEKDAY-]HH:MM`.
        WEEKDAY can be written as the whole word or only using the first 3 characters, HH:MM is an hour from 00:00 to 23:59.

        * 'MON-00:00,FRI-15:00' - can be executed from Monday to Friday 3PM
        * '23:00,06:00' - can be executed every night from 11PM to 6AM
        * '23:00,06:00,SAT-00:00,SUN-23:59' - can be executed every night from 11PM to 6AM and all day during the weekend
inherited_options:
    - name: api-cert-file
      usage: |
        File `path` to HTTPS client certificate used to access the Scylla Manager server when client certificate validation is enabled (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_CERT_FILE).
    - name: api-key-file
      usage: |
        File `path` to HTTPS client key associated with --api-cert-file flag (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_KEY_FILE).
    - name: api-url
      default_value: http://127.0.0.1:5080/api/v1
      usage: |
        Base `URL` of Scylla Manager server (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_URL).
        If running sctool on the same machine as server, it's generated based on '/etc/scylla-manager/scylla-manager.yaml' file.
