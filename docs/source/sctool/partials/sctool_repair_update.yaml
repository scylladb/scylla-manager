name: sctool repair update
synopsis: Modify properties of the existing repair task
description: |
  This command allows you to modify properties of an already existing repair task.
  If there is one repair task the 'repair/task-id' argument is not needed.
usage: sctool repair update --cluster <id|name> [flags] [<repair/task-id>]
options:
- name: cluster
  shorthand: c
  usage: |
    The target cluster `name or ID` (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_CLUSTER).
- name: dc
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |+
    A list of datacenter `glob` patterns separated by a comma, e.g. 'dc1,!otherdc*' used to specify the datacenters to include or exclude.
    The following syntax for glob patterns is supported:

    '*' - matches any number of any characters including none
    '?' - matches any single character
    '[abc]' - matches one character given in the bracket
    '[a-z]' - matches one character from the range given in the bracket

    Patterns are evaluated from left to right.
    If a pattern starts with '!' it unselects items that were selected by previous patterns i.e. 'a?,!aa' selects *ab* but not *aa*.

- name: dry-run
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Validates and displays repair information without actually scheduling the repair.
    This allows you to display what will happen should the repair run with the parameters you set.
- name: enabled
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    Not enabled tasks are not executed and hidden from task list.
- name: fail-fast
  default_value: "false"
- name: help
  shorthand: h
  default_value: "false"
  usage: help for update
- name: host
  usage: |
    Address of a node to repair, you can use either an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
    Specifying the host flag limits repair to token ranges replicated by a given node.
    It can be used in conjunction with --dc flag, in such a case the node must belong to the specified datacenters.
- name: ignore-down-hosts
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Do not repair nodes that are down i.e. in status DN.
- name: intensity
  default_value: "1"
  usage: |
    How many token ranges per shard to repair in a single Scylla node at the same time.
    It can be a decimal between (0,1), in that case it specifies percent of shards that can be repaired in parallel on a repair master node.
    Zero (0) is a special value, the number of token ranges is adjusted to the maximum supported by node (see max_repair_ranges_in_parallel in Scylla logs).
    Changing the intensity impacts repair granularity if you need to resume it, the higher the value the more work on resume.
- name: interval
  shorthand: i
  usage: |
    Time after which a successfully completed task would be run again, supported units are:

    'd' - days
    'h' - hours
    'm' - minutes
    's' - seconds
    'ms' - milliseconds

    The task run date is aligned with '--start date' value.
    For example, if you select '--interval 7d' task would run weekly at the '--start-date' time.
- name: keyspace
  shorthand: K
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |+
    A list of `glob` patterns separated by a comma used to include or exclude tables.
    The patterns match keyspaces and tables, separate the keyspace name from the table name with a dot e.g. 'keyspace,!keyspace.table_prefix_*'.
    The following syntax for glob patterns is supported:

    '*' - matches any number of any characters including none
    '?' - matches any single character
    '[abc]' - matches one character given in the bracket
    '[a-z]' - matches one character from the range given in the bracket

    Patterns are evaluated from left to right.
    If a pattern starts with '!' it unselects items that were selected by previous patterns i.e. 'a?,!aa' selects *ab* but not *aa*.

- name: num-retries
  shorthand: r
  default_value: "0"
  usage: |
    Number of times a task reruns following a failure.
- name: parallel
  default_value: "0"
  usage: |
    The maximum number of Scylla repair jobs that can run at the same time (on different token ranges and replicas).
    Each node can take part in at most one repair at any given moment.
    By default the maximum possible parallelism is used.
    The effective parallelism depends on a keyspace replication factor (RF) and the number of nodes.
    The formula to calculate is is as follows: number of nodes / RF, ex. for 6 node cluster with RF=3 the maximum parallelism is 2.
- name: show-tables
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Prints table names together with keyspace, used in combination with --dry-run.
- name: small-table-threshold
  default_value: 1GiB
  usage: |
    Enables small table optimization for tables of size lower than given threshold, supported units [B, MiB, GiB, TiB].
- name: start-date
  shorthand: s
  usage: |
    The date can be expressed relatively to now or as a RFC3339 formatted string.
    To run the task in 2 hours use 'now+2h', supported units are:

    'd' - days
    'h' - hours
    'm' - minutes
    's' - seconds
    'ms' - milliseconds

    If you want the task to start at a specified date use RFC3339 formatted string i.e. '2018-01-02T15:04:05-07:00'.
    If you want the repair to start immediately, use the value 'now' or skip this flag.
inherited_options:
- name: api-cert-file
  usage: |
    File `path` to HTTPS client certificate used to access the Scylla Manager server when client certificate validation is enabled (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_CERT_FILE).
- name: api-key-file
  usage: |
    File `path` to HTTPS client key associated with --api-cert-file flag (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_KEY_FILE).
- name: api-url
  default_value: http://127.0.0.1:5080/api/v1
  usage: |
    Base `URL` of Scylla Manager server (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_URL).
    If running sctool on the same machine as server, it's generated based on '/etc/scylla-manager/scylla-manager.yaml' file.
