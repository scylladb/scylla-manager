name: sctool backup
synopsis: Schedule a backup (ad-hoc or scheduled)
description: |
  This command allows you to schedule or run ad-hoc cluster backup.
usage: sctool backup --cluster <id|name> --location [<dc>:]<provider>:<bucket> [--keyspace <glob>] [flags]
options:
- name: cluster
  shorthand: c
  usage: |
    The target cluster `name or ID` (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_CLUSTER).
- name: cron
  usage: |
    Task schedule as a cron `expression`.
    It supports the extended syntax including @monthly, @weekly, @daily, @midnight, @hourly, @every X[h|m|s].
- name: dc
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |+
    A list of datacenter `glob` patterns separated by a comma, e.g. 'dc1,!otherdc*' used to specify the datacenters to include or exclude.
    The following syntax for glob patterns is supported:

    '*' - matches any number of any characters including none
    '?' - matches any single character
    '[abc]' - matches one character given in the bracket
    '[a-z]' - matches one character from the range given in the bracket

    Patterns are evaluated from left to right.
    If a pattern starts with '!' it unselects items that were selected by previous patterns i.e. 'a?,!aa' selects *ab* but not *aa*.

- name: dry-run
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Validates and prints backup information without actually scheduling a backup.
- name: enabled
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    Not enabled tasks are not executed and hidden from task list.
- name: help
  shorthand: h
  default_value: "false"
  usage: help for backup
- name: interval
  shorthand: i
  usage: |
    Time after which a successfully completed task would be run again, supported units are:

    'd' - days
    'h' - hours
    'm' - minutes
    's' - seconds
    'ms' - milliseconds

    The task run date is aligned with '--start date' value.
    For example, if you select '--interval 7d' task would run weekly at the '--start-date' time.
- name: keyspace
  shorthand: K
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |+
    A list of `glob` patterns separated by a comma used to include or exclude tables.
    The patterns match keyspaces and tables, separate the keyspace name from the table name with a dot e.g. 'keyspace,!keyspace.table_prefix_*'.
    The following syntax for glob patterns is supported:

    '*' - matches any number of any characters including none
    '?' - matches any single character
    '[abc]' - matches one character given in the bracket
    '[a-z]' - matches one character from the range given in the bracket

    Patterns are evaluated from left to right.
    If a pattern starts with '!' it unselects items that were selected by previous patterns i.e. 'a?,!aa' selects *ab* but not *aa*.

- name: location
  shorthand: L
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    A list of backup locations separated by a comma, specifies where to place the backup, the format is `[<dc>:]<provider>:<bucket>`.
    The '<dc>' parameter is optional it allows to specify location for a datacenter in a multi-dc setting, it must match Scylla nodes datacenter.
    The supported storage '<provider>'s are 'azure', 'gcs', 's3'.
    The 'name' parameter is a bucket name, it must be an alphanumeric string and **may contain a dash and or a dot, but other characters are forbidden**.
- name: name
  usage: |
    Task name that can be used insead of ID.
- name: num-retries
  shorthand: r
  default_value: "3"
  usage: |
    Number of times a task reruns following a failure.
- name: purge-only
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Run the backup cleanup only.
- name: rate-limit
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    Limits the upload rate (as expressed in  megabytes (MiB) per second) at which snapshotfiles can be uploaded from a Scylla node to its backup destination.
    You can set limits for more than one DC using a comma-separated list expressed in the format `[<dc>:]<limit>`.
    The <dc>: part is optional and is only needed when different datacenters require different upload limits.
    Set to 0 for no limit (default 100).
- name: retention
  default_value: "7"
  usage: |
    The `number of backups` to store, once this number is reached, the next backup which comes in from this destination will initiate a purge of the oldest backup.
- name: retention-days
  usage: |
    The number of days to retain a backup. All backups older than this will be purged.
    Set to 0 for no limit (default 0)
- name: retry-wait
  default_value: 10m
  usage: |
    Initial exponential backoff `duration` X[h|m|s].
    With --retry-wait 10m task will wait 10 minutes, 20 minutes and 40 minutes after first, second and third consecutire failure.
- name: show-tables
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Prints table names together with keyspace, used in combination with --dry-run.
- name: snapshot-parallel
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    A comma-separated list of snapshot parallelism limits in the format `[<dc>:]<limit>`.
    The 'dc' part is optional and allows for specifying different limits in selected datacenters.
    If the 'dc' part is not set, the limit is global and the runs are parallel in 'n' nodes.
    If for example, you were to set 'dc1:2,5', then 'dc1' would have two parallel nodes and there would be five parallel nodes in the other DCs.
- name: start-date
  shorthand: s
  usage: |
    The date can be expressed relatively to now or as a RFC3339 formatted string.
    To run the task in 2 hours use 'now+2h', supported units are:

    'd' - days
    'h' - hours
    'm' - minutes
    's' - seconds
    'ms' - milliseconds

    If you want the task to start at a specified date use RFC3339 formatted string i.e. '2018-01-02T15:04:05-07:00'.
    If you want the repair to start immediately, use the value 'now' or skip this flag.
- name: timezone
  default_value: UTC
  usage: |
    Timezone of --cron and --window flag values.
    The default value is taken from this system, namely 'TZ' envvar or '/etc/localtime' file.
- name: upload-parallel
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    A comma-separated list of upload parallelism limits in the format `[<dc>:]<limit>`.
    The 'dc' part is optional and allows for specifying different limits in selected datacenters.
    If the 'dc' part is not set, the limit is global (e.g. 'dc1:2,5') the runs are parallel in 'n' nodes.
    If for example, you were to set 'dc1:2,5', then 'dc1' would have two parallel nodes and there would be five parallel nodes in the other DCs.
- name: window
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    A comma-separated list of time markers in a form `[WEEKDAY-]HH:MM`.
    WEEKDAY can be written as the whole word or only using the first 3 characters, HH:MM is an hour from 00:00 to 23:59.

    'MON-00:00,FRI-15:00' - can be executed from Monday to Friday 3PM
    '23:00,06:00' - can be executed every night from 11PM to 6AM
    '23:00,06:00,SAT-00:00,SUN-23:59' - can be executed every night from 11PM to 6AM and all day during the weekend
inherited_options:
- name: api-cert-file
  usage: |
    File `path` to HTTPS client certificate used to access the Scylla Manager server when client certificate validation is enabled (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_CERT_FILE).
- name: api-key-file
  usage: |
    File `path` to HTTPS client key associated with --api-cert-file flag (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_KEY_FILE).
- name: api-url
  default_value: http://127.0.0.1:5080/api/v1
  usage: |
    Base `URL` of Scylla Manager server (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_API_URL).
    If running sctool on the same machine as server, it's generated based on '/etc/scylla-manager/scylla-manager.yaml' file.
