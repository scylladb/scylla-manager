name: sctool restore update
synopsis: Modify properties of the existing restore task
description: |
    This command allows you to modify properties of an already existing restore task.
    If there is one restore task the 'restore/task-id' argument is not needed.
usage: sctool restore update --cluster <id|name> [flags] [<restore/task-id>]
options:
    - name: batch-size
      default_value: "2"
      usage: |
        Number of SSTables per shard to process in one request by one node.
        Increasing the default batch size might significantly increase restore performance, as only one shard can work on restoring a single SSTable bundle.
    - name: cluster
      shorthand: c
      usage: |
        The target cluster `name or ID` (envvar SCYLLA_MANAGER_CLUSTER).
    - name: cron
      usage: |
        Task schedule as a cron `expression`.
        It supports the extended syntax including @monthly, @weekly, @daily, @midnight, @hourly, @every X[h|m|s].
    - name: dry-run
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Validates and displays restore information without actually running the restore.
        This allows you to display what will happen should the restore run with the parameters you set.
    - name: enabled
      default_value: "true"
      usage: |
        Not enabled tasks are not executed and are hidden from the task list.
    - name: help
      shorthand: h
      default_value: "false"
      usage: help for update
    - name: interval
      shorthand: i
      usage: |
        --interval is deprecated, please use `--cron` instead


        Time after which a successfully completed task would be run again. The supported units are:

        * 'd' - days
        * 'h' - hours
        * 'm' - minutes
        * 's' - seconds
        * 'ms' - milliseconds

        The task run date is aligned with '--start date' value.
        For example, if you select '--interval 7d' task would run weekly at the '--start-date' time.
    - name: keyspace
      shorthand: K
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |+
        A list of `glob` patterns separated by a comma used to include or exclude tables.
        The patterns match keyspaces and tables, separate the keyspace name from the table name with a dot e.g. 'keyspace,!keyspace.table_prefix_*'.
        The following syntax for glob patterns is supported:

        * '*' - matches any number of any characters including none
        * '?' - matches any single character
        * '[abc]' - matches one character given in the bracket
        * '[a-z]' - matches one character from the range given in the bracket

        Patterns are evaluated from left to right.
        If a pattern starts with '!' it unselects items that were selected by previous patterns i.e. 'a?,!aa' selects *ab* but not *aa*.

    - name: location
      shorthand: L
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |
        A list of backup locations separated by a comma, specifies places where restored backup is stored.

        The format is `[<dc>:]<provider>:<bucket>`.
        The `<dc>` parameter is optional. It allows you to specify the datacenter whose nodes will be used to restore the data
        from this location in a multi-dc setting, it must match Scylla nodes datacenter.
        By default, all live nodes are used to restore data from specified locations.

        Note that specifying datacenters closest to backup locations might reduce download time of restored data.
        The supported storage '<provider>'s are 'azure', 'gcs', 's3'.
        The `<bucket>` parameter is a bucket name, it must be an alphanumeric string and **may contain a dash and or a dot, but other characters are forbidden**.
    - name: name
      usage: |
        Task name that can be used insead of ID.
    - name: num-retries
      shorthand: r
      default_value: "3"
      usage: |
        Number of times a task reruns following a failure.
    - name: parallel
      default_value: "1"
      usage: |
        The maximum number of Scylla restore jobs that can be run at the same time (on different SSTables).
        Each node can take part in at most one restore at any given moment.
    - name: restore-schema
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Specifies restore type (alternative to '--restore-tables' flag).
        Restore will recreate schema by applying the backed up output of DESCRIBE SCHEMA WITH INTERNALS via CQL.
        It requires that restored keyspaces aren't present in the cluster.
        For the full list of prerequisites, please see https://manager.docs.scylladb.com/stable/restore/restore-schema.html.
    - name: restore-tables
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Specifies restore type (alternative to '--restore-schema' flag).
        Restore will recreate contents of tables specified by '--keyspace' flag.
        It requires that correct schema of restored tables is already present in the cluster (schema can be restored using '--restore-schema' flag).
        Moreover, in order to prevent situation in which current tables' contents overlaps restored data,
        tables should be truncated before initializing restore.
        For the full list of prerequisites, please see https://manager.docs.scylladb.com/stable/restore/restore-tables.html.
    - name: retry-wait
      default_value: 10m
      usage: |
        Initial exponential backoff `duration` X[h|m|s].
        With --retry-wait 10m task will wait 10 minutes, 20 minutes and 40 minutes after first, second and third consecutire failure.
    - name: show-tables
      default_value: "false"
      usage: |
        Prints table names together with keyspace, used in combination with --dry-run.
    - name: snapshot-tag
      shorthand: T
      usage: |
        Scylla Manager snapshot tag identifying restored backup.
        Snapshot tags can be obtained from backup listing ('./sctool backup list' command - e.g. sm_20060102150405UTC).
    - name: start-date
      shorthand: s
      usage: |
        The date can be expressed relatively to now or as a RFC3339 formatted string.
        To run the task in 2 hours use 'now+2h'. The supported units are:

        * 'd' - days
        * 'h' - hours
        * 'm' - minutes
        * 's' - seconds
        * 'ms' - milliseconds

        If you want the task to start at a specified date use RFC3339 formatted string i.e. '2018-01-02T15:04:05-07:00'.
        If you want the repair to start immediately, use the value 'now' or skip this flag.
    - name: timezone
      default_value: UTC
      usage: |
        Timezone of --cron and --window flag values.
        The default value is taken from this system, namely 'TZ' envvar or '/etc/localtime' file.
    - name: window
      default_value: '[]'
      usage: |
        A comma-separated list of time markers in a form `[WEEKDAY-]HH:MM`.

        * 'MON-00:00,FRI-15:00' - can be executed from Monday to Friday 3PM
        * '23:00,06:00' - can be executed every night from 11PM to 6AM
        * '23:00,06:00,SAT-00:00,SUN-23:59' - can be executed every night from 11PM to 6AM and all day during the weekend
