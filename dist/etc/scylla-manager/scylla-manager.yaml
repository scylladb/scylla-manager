# Version of TLS protocol and cipher suites to use with HTTPS.
# The supported versions are: TLSv1.3, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.0.
# The TLSv1.2 is restricted to the following cipher suites:
# ECDHE-ECDSA-WITH-AES-128-GCM-SHA256, ECDHE-RSA-WITH-AES-128-GCM-SHA256,
# ECDHE-ECDSA-WITH-AES-256-GCM-SHA384, ECDHE-RSA-WITH-AES-256-GCM-SHA384,
# ECDHE-ECDSA-WITH-CHACHA20-POLY1305, ECDHE-RSA-WITH-CHACHA20-POLY1305.
# The TLSv1.0 should never be used as it's deprecated.
#tls_mode: TLSv1.2

# TLS certificate and key files to use with HTTPS. The files must contain PEM
# encoded data. If not set a self-signed certificate will be generated,
# the certificate is valid for 1 year after start and uses EC P256 private key.

# CA to validate client certificates, if set client must present a certificate

# Bind prometheus API to the specified TCP address using HTTP protocol.
# By default it binds to all network interfaces but you can restrict it

# Logging configuration.
#logger:
# Where to print logs, stderr or stdout.
#  mode: stderr
# How much logs to print, available levels are: error, info, debug.
#  level: info
# Sampling reduces number of logs by not printing duplicated log entries within
# a second. The first N (initial) entries with a given level and message are
# printed. If more entries with the same level and message are seen during
# the same interval, every Mth (thereafter) message is logged and the rest is
# dropped.

# Dynamic timeout calculates timeout based on past measurements.
# It takes recent RTTs, calculates mean (m), standard deviation (stddev),
# and returns timeout of next probe equal to m + stddev_multiplier * max(stddev, 1ms).
#
# Higher stddev_multiplier is recommended on stable network environments,
# because standard deviation may be close to 0.

#repair:
# Frequency Scylla Manager poll Scylla node for repair command status.
#  poll_interval: 50ms
#
# Maximal time a paused repair is considered fresh and can be continued,
# if exceeded repair will start from the beginning. Zero means no limit.

# Specifies how long repair will wait until all ongoing repair requests finish
# when repair task is stopped. After this time, task will be interrupted.
#  graceful_stop_timeout: 30s
#
# Force usage of certain type of repair algorithm. Allowed values are row_level, legacy, and auto.
# row_level means that Scylla Manager will use row level repair optimised algorithm.
# legacy means that Scylla Manager will be splitting ranges to shards when making repair requests.
# Default value is auto which means that repair type will be auto detected based on Scylla versions in the managed cluster.
