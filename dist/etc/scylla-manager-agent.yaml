# Specify authentication token, the auth_token needs to be the same for all the

# Bind REST API to the specified TCP address using HTTPS protocol. By default
# Scylla Manager Agent uses Scylla listen/broadcast address that is read from
# the Scylla API (see scylla section).

# Use custom port instead of default 10001.
#https_port:

# Version of TLS protocol and cipher suites to use with HTTPS.
# The supported versions are: TLSv1.3, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.0.
# The TLSv1.2 is restricted to the following cipher suites:
# ECDHE-ECDSA-WITH-AES-128-GCM-SHA256, ECDHE-RSA-WITH-AES-128-GCM-SHA256,
# ECDHE-ECDSA-WITH-AES-256-GCM-SHA384, ECDHE-RSA-WITH-AES-256-GCM-SHA384,
# ECDHE-ECDSA-WITH-CHACHA20-POLY1305, ECDHE-RSA-WITH-CHACHA20-POLY1305.
# The TLSv1.0 should never be used as it's deprecated.
#tls_mode: TLSv1.2

# TLS certificate and key files to use with HTTPS. The files must contain PEM
# encoded data. If not set a self-signed certificate will be generated,
# the certificate is valid for 1 year after start and uses EC P256 private key.

# Bind prometheus API to the specified TCP address using HTTP protocol.
# By default it binds to all network interfaces but you can restrict it
# by specifying it like this 127:0.0.1:5090 or any other combination
# of ip and port.
#prometheus: ':5090'

# Debug server that allows to run pporf profiling on demand on a live system.
#debug: 127.0.0.1:5112

# CPU to run Scylla Manager Agent on. By default the agent would read Scylla
# configuration at /etc/scylla.d/cpuset.conf and try to find a core not used by
# Scylla. If that's not possible user can specify a core to run agent on.
#cpu: 0

# Logging configuration.
#logger:
# Where to print logs, stderr or stdout.
#  mode: stderr
# How much logs to print, available levels are: error, info, debug.
#  level: info
# Sampling reduces number of logs by not printing duplicated log entries within
# a second. The first N (initial) entries with a given level and message are
# printed. If more entries with the same level and message are seen during
# the same interval, every Mth (thereafter) message is logged and the rest is
# dropped.
#  sampling:
#    initial: 1
#    thereafter: 100

# Copy api_address and api_port values from /etc/scylla/scylla.yaml. All the
# needed Scylla configuration options are read from the API.

# Backup general configuration.
#rclone:
# The number of checkers to run in parallel. Checkers do the equality checking
# of files (local vs. backup location) at the beginning of backup.
#  checkers: 100
#
# The number of file transfers to run in parallel. It can sometimes be useful
# to set this to a smaller number if the remote is giving a lot of timeouts or
# bigger if you have lots of bandwidth and a fast remote.
#  transfers: 2
#
# Number of low level retries to do. This applies to operations like file chunk upload.
