# Version of TLS protocol and cipher suites to use with HTTPS.
# The supported versions are: TLSv1.3, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.0.
# The TLSv1.2 is restricted to the following cipher suites:
# ECDHE-ECDSA-WITH-AES-128-GCM-SHA256, ECDHE-RSA-WITH-AES-128-GCM-SHA256,
# ECDHE-ECDSA-WITH-AES-256-GCM-SHA384, ECDHE-RSA-WITH-AES-256-GCM-SHA384,
# ECDHE-ECDSA-WITH-CHACHA20-POLY1305, ECDHE-RSA-WITH-CHACHA20-POLY1305.
# The TLSv1.0 should never be used as it's deprecated.
#tls_mode: TLSv1.2

# TLS certificate and key files to use with HTTPS. The files must contain PEM
# encoded data. If not set a self-signed certificate will be generated,
# the certificate is valid for 1 year after start and uses EC P256 private key.

# Logging configuration.
#logger:
# Where to print logs, stderr or stdout.
#  mode: stderr
# How much logs to print, available levels are: error, info, debug.
#  level: info
# Sampling reduces number of logs by not printing duplicated log entries within
# a second. The first N (initial) entries with a given level and message are
# printed. If more entries with the same level and message are seen during
# the same interval, every Mth (thereafter) message is logged and the rest is
# dropped.
