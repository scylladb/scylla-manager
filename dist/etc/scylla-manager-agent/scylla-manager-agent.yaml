# Bind REST API to the specified TCP address using HTTPS protocol. By default
# Scylla Manager Agent uses Scylla listen/broadcast address that is read from
# the Scylla API (see scylla section).

# TLS certificate and key files to use with HTTPS. To regenerate the files use

# Bind prometheus API to the specified TCP address using HTTP protocol.
# By default it binds to all network interfaces but you can restrict it

# CPU to run Scylla Manager Agent on. By default the agent would read Scylla
