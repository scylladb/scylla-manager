short: Change parameters while a repair is running

long: |
  This command allows you to modify repair parameters while a repair is running.
  Note that modified parameters apply only to the currently running task and not to the future task runs.
  For modifying future repair task runs see 'sctool repair update' command.

intensity: |
  How many token ranges per shard to repair in a single Scylla node at the same time.
  Zero (0) is a special value, the number of token ranges is adjusted to the maximum supported by node (see max_repair_ranges_in_parallel in Scylla logs).
  Changing the intensity impacts repair granularity if you need to resume it, the higher the value the more work on resume.

parallel: |
  The maximum number of Scylla repair jobs that can run at the same time (on different token ranges and replicas).
  Each node can take part in at most one repair at any given moment.
  By default the maximum possible parallelism is used.
  The effective parallelism depends on a keyspace replication factor (RF) and the number of nodes.
  The formula to calculate is is as follows: number of nodes / RF, ex. for 6 node cluster with RF=3 the maximum parallelism is 2.
