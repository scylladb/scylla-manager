use: repair --cluster <id|name> [--intensity] [--parallel] [flags]

short: Schedule a repair (ad-hoc or scheduled)

long: |
  This command allows you to schedule or run ad-hoc cluster repair.
  Repair speed is controlled by two flags --parallel and --intensity.
  The values of those flags can be adjusted while a repair is running using the control subcommand.

host: |
  Address of a node to repair, you can use either an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
  Specifying the host flag limits repair to token ranges replicated by a given node.
  It can be used in conjunction with --dc flag, in such a case the node must belong to the specified datacenters.

ignore-down-hosts: |
  Do not repair nodes that are down i.e. in status DN.

intensity: |
  How many token ranges per shard to repair in a single Scylla node at the same time.
  It can be a decimal between (0,1), in that case it specifies percent of shards that can be repaired in parallel on a repair master node.
  Zero (0) is a special value, the number of token ranges is adjusted to the maximum supported by node (see max_repair_ranges_in_parallel in Scylla logs).
  Changing the intensity impacts repair granularity if you need to resume it, the higher the value the more work on resume.

parallel: |
  The maximum number of Scylla repair jobs that can run at the same time (on different token ranges and replicas).
  Each node can take part in at most one repair at any given moment.
  By default the maximum possible parallelism is used.
  The effective parallelism depends on a keyspace replication factor (RF) and the number of nodes.
  The formula to calculate is is as follows: number of nodes / RF, ex. for 6 node cluster with RF=3 the maximum parallelism is 2.

small-table-threshold: |
  Enables small table optimization for tables of size lower than given threshold, supported units [B, M, G, T].

dry-run: |
  Validates and displays repair information without actually scheduling the repair.
  This allows you to display what will happen should the repair run with the parameters you set.

show-tables: |
  Prints table names together with keyspace, used in combination with --dry-run.
