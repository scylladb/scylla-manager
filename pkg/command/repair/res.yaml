use: repair --cluster <id|name> [--intensity] [--parallel] [flags]

short: Schedule a repair (ad-hoc or scheduled)

long: |
  This command allows you to schedule or run ad-hoc cluster repair.
  Repair speed is controlled by two flags --parallel and --intensity.
  The values of those flags can be adjusted while a repair is running using the control subcommand.

host: |
  Address of a node to repair, you can use either an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
  Specifying the host flag limits repair to token ranges replicated by a given node.
  It can be used in conjunction with --dc flag, in such a case the node must belong to the specified datacenters.

ignore-down-hosts: |
  Do not repair nodes that are down i.e. in status DN.

intensity: |
  How many token ranges to repair in a single Scylla node at the same time.
  Zero (0) is a special value, the number of token ranges is adjusted to the maximum supported (see repair docs for more information).
  Changing the intensity impacts repair granularity if you need to resume it, the higher the value the more work on resume.
  If you set intensity to a value greater than the maximum supported by the node, intensity will be capped at that maximum.
  See effectively used intensity value in the display of 'sctool progress repair' command.

parallel: |
  The maximum number of Scylla repair jobs that can run at the same time (on different token ranges and replicas).
  Each node can take part in at most one repair at any given moment. By default the maximum possible parallelism is used.
  The maximal effective parallelism depends on keyspace replication strategy and cluster topology (see repair docs for more information).
  If you set parallel to a value greater than the maximum supported by the node, parallel will be capped at that maximum.
  See effectively used parallel value in the display of 'sctool progress repair' command.

small-table-threshold: |
  Enables small table optimization for tables of size lower than given threshold, supported units [B, M, G, T].

dry-run: |
  Validates and displays repair information without actually scheduling the repair.
  This allows you to display what will happen should the repair run with the parameters you set.

show-tables: |
  Prints table names together with keyspace, used in combination with --dry-run.
