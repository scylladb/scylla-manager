use: restore --cluster <id|name> --location [<dc>:]<provider>:<bucket> --snapshot-tag <tag> [flags]

short: Run an ad-hoc restore of schema or tables

long: |
  This command allows you to run an ad-hoc restore.
  Restore is always one of two types: restore schema ('--restore-schema' flag) or restore tables' contents ('--restore-tables' flag).
  In both cases, for the restore effects to be visible, you need to perform
  a specific follow-up action described by selected type.

location: |
  A list of backup locations separated by a comma, specifies places where restored backup is stored.
  
  The format is `[<dc>:]<provider>:<bucket>`.
  The `<dc>` parameter is optional. It allows you to specify the datacenter whose nodes will be used to restore the data
  from this location in a multi-dc setting, it must match Scylla nodes datacenter.
  By default, all live nodes are used to restore data from specified locations.
  
  Note that specifying datacenters closest to backup locations might reduce download time of restored data.
  The supported storage '<provider>'s are 'azure', 'gcs', 's3'.
  The `<bucket>` parameter is a bucket name, it must be an alphanumeric string and **may contain a dash and or a dot, but other characters are forbidden**.

snapshot-tag: |
  Scylla Manager snapshot tag identifying restored backup.
  Snapshot tags can be obtained from backup listing ('./sctool backup list' command - e.g. sm_20060102150405UTC).

batch-size: |
  Number of SSTables per shard to process in one request by one node.
  Increasing the default batch size might significantly increase restore performance, as only one shard can work on restoring a single SSTable bundle.

parallel: |
  The maximum number of Scylla restore jobs that can be run at the same time (on different SSTables).
  Each node can take part in at most one restore at any given moment.

restore-schema: |
  Specifies restore type (alternative to '--restore-tables' flag).
  Restore will recreate schema by applying the backed up output of DESCRIBE SCHEMA WITH INTERNALS via CQL.
  It requires that restored keyspaces aren't present in the cluster.
  For the full list of prerequisites, please see https://manager.docs.scylladb.com/stable/restore/restore-schema.html.

restore-tables: |
  Specifies restore type (alternative to '--restore-schema' flag).
  Restore will recreate contents of tables specified by '--keyspace' flag.
  It requires that correct schema of restored tables is already present in the cluster (schema can be restored using '--restore-schema' flag).
  Moreover, in order to prevent situation in which current tables' contents overlaps restored data,
  tables should be truncated before initializing restore.
  For the full list of prerequisites, please see https://manager.docs.scylladb.com/stable/restore/restore-tables.html.

dry-run: |
  Validates and displays restore information without actually running the restore.
  This allows you to display what will happen should the restore run with the parameters you set.

show-tables: |
  Prints table names together with keyspace, used in combination with --dry-run.
