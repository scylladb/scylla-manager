use: suspend --cluster <id|name> [--duration] [--on-resume-start-tasks]

short: Stop execution of all tasks

long: |
  This command stops execution of **all** tasks that are running on a cluster.
  The tasks can be resumed using the resume command.

  When the suspend command is executed:

  * The running tasks are stopped
  * The scheduled tasks are canceled
  * Starting a task manually fails

  The health check tasks are an exception and they run even after suspend.

duration:
  Automatically resume after the given `duration` X[h|m|s].

on-resume-start-tasks:
  On resume start tasks that were stopped by the suspend.

no-continue: |
  Start tasks from scratch on resume. It allows for performing additional cleanup of disabled tasks.
  Doesn't work with --duration.

allow-task-type: |
  Tasks of this type will keep on being executed and scheduled even when cluster is suspended.

suspend-policy: |
  Describes behavior towards running tasks (other than '--allow-task-type').
  Doesn't work with --duration.
  It accepts the following values:
  
  * 'stop_running_tasks': results in stopping running tasks.
  * 'fail_if_running_tasks': results in failing to suspend cluster and returning 409 HTTP status code.
