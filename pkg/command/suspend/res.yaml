use: suspend --cluster <id|name>

short: Stop execution of all tasks

long: |
  This command stops execution of **all** tasks that are running on a cluster.
  The tasks can be resumed using the resume command.

  When the suspend command is executed:

  * The running tasks are stopped
  * The scheduled tasks are canceled
  * Starting a task manually fails

  The health check tasks are an exception and they run even after suspend.
