enabled: |
  Not enabled tasks are not executed and are hidden from the task list.

name: |
  Task name that can be used instead of ID.

label: |
  A comma-separated list of label modifications. Labels are represented as a key-value store.
  Character '=' has a special meaning and cannot be a part of label's key nor value.
  A single modification takes form of:
  * '<key>=<value>' - sets the label <key> to <value>
  * '<key>-'        - removes the label
  
  For example, ``--label k1=v1,k2-`` will set the label 'k1' to 'v1' and will also remove label 'k2'.

cron: |
  Task schedule as a cron `expression`.
  It supports the extended syntax including @monthly, @weekly, @daily, @midnight, @hourly, @every X[h|m|s].

window: |
  A comma-separated list of time markers in a form `[WEEKDAY-]HH:MM`.
  WEEKDAY can be written as the whole word or only using the first 3 characters, HH:MM is an hour from 00:00 to 23:59.

  * 'MON-00:00,FRI-15:00' - can be executed from Monday to Friday 3PM
  * '23:00,06:00' - can be executed every night from 11PM to 6AM
  * '23:00,06:00,SAT-00:00,SUN-23:59' - can be executed every night from 11PM to 6AM and all day during the weekend

timezone: |
  Timezone of --cron and --window flag values.
  The default value is taken from this system, namely 'TZ' envvar or '/etc/localtime' file.

interval: |
  --interval is deprecated, please use `--cron` instead


  Time after which a successfully completed task would be run again. The supported units are:

  * ``d`` - days
  * ``h`` - hours
  * ``m`` - minutes
  * ``s`` - seconds
  * ``ms`` - milliseconds

  The task run date is aligned with ``--start date`` value.
  For example, if you select ``--interval 7d`` task would run weekly at the ``--start-date`` time.

start-date: |
  The date can be expressed relatively to now or as a RFC3339 formatted string.
  To run the task in 2 hours use 'now+2h'. The supported units are:
  
  * 'd' - days
  * 'h' - hours
  * 'm' - minutes
  * 's' - seconds
  * 'ms' - milliseconds
  
  If you want the task to start at a specified date use RFC3339 formatted string i.e. '2018-01-02T15:04:05-07:00'.
  If you want the repair to start immediately, use the value 'now' or skip this flag.

num-retries: |
  Number of times a task reruns following a failure.

retry-wait: |
  Initial exponential backoff `duration` X[h|m|s].
  With --retry-wait 10m task will wait 10 minutes, 20 minutes and 40 minutes after first, second and third consecutire failure.
