  Time after which a successfully completed task would be run again, supported units are:

  * ``d`` - days
  * ``h`` - hours
  * ``m`` - minutes
  * ``s`` - seconds
  * ``ms`` - milliseconds

  The task run date is aligned with ``--start date`` value.
  For example, if you select ``--interval 7d`` task would run weekly at the ``--start-date`` time.

start-date: |
  The date can be expressed relatively to now or as a RFC3339 formatted string.
  To run the task in 2 hours use ``now+2h``, supported units are:

  * ``d`` - days
  * ``h`` - hours
  * ``m`` - minutes
  * ``s`` - seconds
  * ``ms`` - milliseconds

  If you want the task to start at a specified date use RFC3339 formatted string i.e. ``2018-01-02T15:04:05-07:00``.
  If you want the repair to start immediately, use the value ``now`` or skip this flag.
