glob: |
  The following syntax for glob patterns is supported:

  * ``*`` - matches any number of any characters including none
  * ``?`` - matches any single character
  * ``[abc]`` - matches one character given in the bracket
  * ``[a-z]`` - matches one character from the range given in the bracket

  Patterns are evaluated from left to right.
  If a pattern starts with ``!`` it unselects items that were selected by previous patterns i.e. ``a?,!aa`` selects *ab* but not *aa*.

keyspace: |
  A list of `glob` patterns separated by a comma used to include or exclude tables.
