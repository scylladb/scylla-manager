short: Validate backup files in remote locations

long: |
  This command schedules a backup validation task.
  It checks that all needed files are in tact, and that there are no unexpected files occupying your storage.
  To delete the unexpected files provide the '--delete-orphaned-files' parameter.
  To see the validation results use :ref:`task-progress` command.
  It is safe to run backup and backup validation at the same time.
