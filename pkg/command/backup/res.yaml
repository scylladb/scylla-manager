use: backup --cluster <id|name> --location [<dc>:]<provider>:<bucket> [--keyspace <glob>] [flags]

short: Schedule a backup (ad-hoc or scheduled)

long: |
  This command allows you to schedule or run ad-hoc cluster backup.

retention: |
  The `number of backups` to store, once this number is reached, the next backup which comes in from this destination will initiate a purge of the oldest backup.
  Can be used simultaneously with '--retention-days' flag.

retention-days: |
  The `number of days` for which backup is stored, the next backup will initiate a purge of all expired backups.
  Can be used simultaneously with '--retention' flag.

rate-limit: |
  Limits the upload rate (as expressed in  megabytes (MiB) per second) at which snapshotfiles can be uploaded from a Scylla node to its backup destination.
  You can set limits for more than one DC using a comma-separated list expressed in the format `[<dc>:]<limit>`.
  The <dc>: part is optional and is only needed when different datacenters require different upload limits.
  Set to 0 for no limit (default 100).

snapshot-parallel: |
  A comma-separated list of snapshot parallelism limits in the format `[<dc>:]<limit>`.
  The ``dc`` part is optional and allows for specifying different limits in selected datacenters.
  If the ``dc`` part is not set, the limit is global and the runs are parallel in ``n`` nodes.
  If for example, you were to set 'dc1:2,5', then ``dc1`` would have two parallel nodes and there would be five parallel nodes in the other DCs.

upload-parallel: |
  A comma-separated list of upload parallelism limits in the format `[<dc>:]<limit>`.
  The ``dc`` part is optional and allows for specifying different limits in selected datacenters.
  If the ``dc`` part is not set, the limit is global (e.g. 'dc1:2,5') the runs are parallel in ``n`` nodes.
  If for example, you were to set 'dc1:2,5', then ``dc1`` would have two parallel nodes and there would be five parallel nodes in the other DCs.

dry-run: |
  Validates and prints backup information without actually scheduling a backup.

show-tables: |
  Prints table names together with keyspace, used in combination with --dry-run.

purge-only: |
  Run the backup cleanup only.

skip-schema: |
  Don't backup schema.
  For ScyllaDB versions starting at 6.0 and 2024.2, SM requires CQL credentials to back up the schema.
  CQL Credentials can be added with 'sctool cluster update --username --password' command.
  This flag can be used to skip this step and allow for backing up user data without providing SM with CQL credentials.
  Note that it's impossible to restore schema from such backups.
