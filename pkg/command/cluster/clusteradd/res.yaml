short: Add a cluster to manager

long: |
  This command adds the specified cluster to the Scylla Manager.
  Once a Scylla cluster is added, a weekly repair task is also added.
  Before continuing make sure the cluster that you want to add is prepared for it,
  see https://manager.docs.scylladb.com/stable/add-a-cluster.html for instructions.

example: |
  sctool cluster add --host 34.203.122.52 --name prod-cluster --auth-token "6Es3dm24U72NzAu9ANWmU3C4ALyVZhwwPZZPWtK10eYGHJ24wMoh9SQxRZEluWMc0qDrsWCCshvfhk9uewOimQS2x5yNTYUEoIkO1VpSmTFu5fsFyoDgEkmNrCJpXtfM"

   __
  /  \     Cluster added! You can set it as default, by exporting env variable.
  @  @     $ export SCYLLA_MANAGER_CLUSTER=c1bbabf3-cad1-4a59-ab8f-84e2a73b623f
  |  |     $ export SCYLLA_MANAGER_CLUSTER=prod-cluster
  || |/
  || ||    Now run:
  |\_/|    $ sctool status -c prod-cluster
  \___/    $ sctool tasks -c prod-cluster

id: |
  Explicitly specify cluster ID, when not provided random `UUID` will be generated.

name: |
  When a cluster is added, it is assigned a unique identifier.
  Use this parameter to identify the cluster by an alias name which is more meaningful.
  This `alias` name can be used with all commands that accept --cluster parameter.

label: |
  A comma-separated list of label modifications. Labels are represented as a key-value store.
  Character '=' has a special meaning and cannot be a part of label's key nor value.
  A single modification takes form of:
  * '<key>=<value>' - sets the label <key> to <value>
  * '<key>-'        - removes the label
  
  For example, ``--label k1=v1,k2-`` will set the label 'k1' to 'v1' and will also remove label 'k2'.

host: |
  Hostname or `IP` of the node that will be used to discover other nodes belonging to the cluster.
  Note that this will be persisted and used every time Scylla Manager starts.
  You can use either an IPv4 or IPv6 address.

port: |
  Alternate Scylla Manager agent `port`.

auth-token: |
  The authentication `token` you identified in ``/etc/scylla-manager-agent/scylla-manager-agent.yaml``.

username: |
  CQL `username`, for security reasons this user should NOT have access to your data.
  If you specify the CQL username and password, the CQL health check you see in status command would try to login and execute a query against system keyspace.
  Otherwise CQL health check is based on sending CQL OPTIONS frame and does not start a CQL session.

password: |
  CQL `password` associated with username.

ssl-user-cert-file: |
  File `path` to client certificate when Scylla uses client/server encryption (require_client_auth enabled).

ssl-user-key-file: |
  File `path` to key associated with --ssl-user-cert-file flag.

without-repair: |
  When cluster is added, Manager schedules repair to repeat weekly.
  Use this flag to create a cluster without a scheduled repair.

force-tls-disabled: |
  Forces Scylla Manager to always disable TLS for the cluster's CQL session, even if TLS is enabled in scylla.yaml.

force-non-ssl-session-port: |
  Forces Scylla Manager to always use the non-SSL port for TLS-enabled cluster CQL sessions.
